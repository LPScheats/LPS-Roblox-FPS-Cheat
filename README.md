## How It Works

### Aimbot
The aimbot automatically locks onto the closest enemy's torso. It uses a wall-check with raycasting to ensure you’re not locking onto anything obstructed by walls or objects, giving you the most efficient targeting possible.

### ESP
Once enabled, the ESP feature displays the name of every player above their head. This helps you track enemies, teammates, and identify important targets even through walls.

### Teleportation
You can teleport to any player’s location by simply clicking their name in the teleport menu. This feature eliminates the need to run across the map, making it easier to engage enemies or assist allies.

### Local Player Enhancements
Activate **Insane Speed** to zoom across the map, making you nearly impossible to catch, or turn on **Ultra Jump** to defy gravity and perform extreme jumps to reach difficult spots or avoid enemies.

### Other Scripts
- **Infinite Yield**: Run advanced commands that can help you manipulate the game world in various ways.
- **Rejoin Server**: Automatically reconnect to the server if you’ve been banned, disconnected, or kicked for any reason.
